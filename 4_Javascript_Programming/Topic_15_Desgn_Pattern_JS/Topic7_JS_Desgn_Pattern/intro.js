/*
	In this section, we will explore JavaScript implementations of a 
		number of both classic and modern design patterns.

	Developers commonly wonder whether there is an ideal pattern or 
		set of patterns they should be using in their workflow. There 
		isn't a true single answer to this question; each script and 
		web application we work on is likely to have its own individual 
		needs and we need to think about where we feel a pattern can 
		offer real value to an implementation.

	For example, some projects may benefit from the decoupling benefits 
		offered by the Observer pattern (which reduces how dependent parts 
		of an application are on one another) whilst others may simply be 
		too small for decoupling to be a concern at all.

	That said, once we have a firm grasp of design patterns and the specific 
		problems they are best suited to, it becomes much easier to integrate 
		them into our application architectures.

 

	The patterns we will be exploring in this section are the:

	    Constructor Pattern
	    Module Pattern
	    Revealing Module Pattern
	    Singleton Pattern
	    Observer Pattern
	    Mediator Pattern
	    Prototype Pattern
	    Command Pattern
	    Facade Pattern
	    Factory Pattern
	    Mixin Pattern
	    Decorator Pattern
	    Flyweight Pattern
