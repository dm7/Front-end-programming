			Finally, if you don't want to define another alternative 
			to the full jQuery function name (you really like to use $ 
			and don't care about using the other library's $ method), 
			then there's still another approach you might try: simply 
			add the $ as an argument passed to your jQuery( document ).ready() 
			function. This is most frequently used in the case where you 
			still want the benefits of really concise jQuery code, but 
			don't want to cause conflicts with other libraries.
