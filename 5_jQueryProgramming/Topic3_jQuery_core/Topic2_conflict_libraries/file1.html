		<!-- Putting jQuery into no-conflict mode. -->
		<!-- 
			The jQuery library and virtually all of its plugins are 
			contained within the jQuery namespace. As a general rule, 
			global objects are stored inside the jQuery namespace as 
			well, so you shouldn't get a clash between jQuery and any 
			other library (like prototype.js, MooTools, or YUI).

			That said, there is one caveat: by default, jQuery uses $ 
			as a shortcut for jQuery. Thus, if you are using another 
			JavaScript library that uses the $ variable, you can run 
			into conflicts with jQuery. In order to avoid these conflicts, 
			you need to put jQuery in no-conflict mode immediately after 
			it is loaded onto the page and before you attempt to use 
			jQuery in your page.

		<script type="text/javascript" src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.min.js">
		</script>
		<script type="text/javascript">
			var $j = jQuery.noConflict();
			// $j is now an alias to the jQuery function; creating the new alias is optional.
			 
			$j(document).ready(function() {
			    $j( "div" ).hide();
			});	
		</script>
		<script type="text/javascript">
			//Code using prototype.js
			// The $ variable now has the meaning that prototype.js carries, which is a shortcut for
			// document.getElementById(). mainDiv below is a DOM element, not a jQuery object.
			window.onload = function() {
			    var mainDiv = $( "main" );
			}
		</script>
		<!-- 
			
			In the code above, the $ will revert back to its meaning in original 
			library. You'll still be able to use the full function name jQuery 
			as well as the new alias $j in the rest of your application. 
			The new alias can be named anything you'd like: jq, $J, awesomeQuery, etc.
