          Syntax:
              .addClass( className )
          
          Description: Adds the specified class(es) to each element in the set of matched elements.

          It's important to note that this method does not replace a 
          class. It simply adds the class, appending it to any which 
          may already be assigned to the elements.

          The .addClass() method manipulates the className property 
          of the selected elements, not the class attribute. Once 
          the property is changed, it's the browser that updates 
          the attribute accordingly. An implication of this behavior 
          is that this method only works for documents with HTML DOM 
          semantics (e.g., not pure XML documents).
          
          More than one class may be added at a time, separated by a 
          space, to the set of matched elements, like so:
          
          > $( "p" ).addClass( "myClass yourClass" );

          This method is often used with .removeClass() to switch elements' 
          classes from one to another, like so:

          > $( "p" ).removeClass( "myClass noClass" ).addClass( "yourClass" );

          Here, the myClass and noClass classes are removed from all paragraphs, 
          while yourClass is added.

          As of jQuery 1.4, the .addClass() method's argument can receive a function.

          > $( "ul li" ).addClass(function( index ) {
                return "item-" + index;
              });
          
          Given an unordered list with two <li> elements, this example adds 
          the class "item-0" to the first <li> and "item-1" to the second.
