	  	 	Syntax:
	  	 		.html( htmlString )

	  	 	Returns: jQuery object

	  	 	Description: Set the HTML contents of each element in 
	  	 					the set of matched elements.

	  	 	The .html() method is not available in XML documents.

			When .html() is used to set an element's content, any content 
			that was in that element is completely replaced by the new content. 
			Additionally, jQuery removes other constructs such as data 
			and event handlers from child elements before replacing those 
			elements with the new content.

			Consider the following HTML:

			<div class="demo-container">
			  <div class="demo-box">Demonstration Box</div>
			</div>

			The content of <div class="demo-container"> can be set like this:

			> $( "div.demo-container" )
						.html( "<p>All new content. <em>You bet!</em></p>" );

			That line of code will replace everything inside <div class="demo-container">:

			<div class="demo-container">
			  <p>All new content. <em>You bet!</em></p>
			</div>

			As of jQuery 1.4, the .html() method allows the HTML content 
				to be set by passing in a function.

			> $( "div.demo-container" ).html(function() {
					  var emphasis = "<em>" + $( "p" ).length + " paragraphs!</em>";
					  return "<p>All new content for " + emphasis + "</p>";
					});

			Given a document with six paragraphs, this example will set the 
			HTML of <div class="demo-container"> to 
			<p>All new content for <em>6 paragraphs!</em></p>.			

			This method uses the browser's innerHTML property. Some browsers 
			may not generate a DOM that exactly replicates the HTML source 
			provided. For example, Internet Explorer prior to version 8 
			will convert all href properties on links to absolute URLs, 
			and Internet Explorer prior to version 9 will not correctly 
			handle HTML5 elements without the addition of a separate compatibility layer.

			To set the content of a <script> element, which does not 
			contain HTML, use the .text() method and not .html().
