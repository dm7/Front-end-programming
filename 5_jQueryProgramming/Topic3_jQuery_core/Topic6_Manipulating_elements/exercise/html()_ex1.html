	  		Syntax:
	  			.html()

	  		Returns: String

	  		Description: Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements.

	  		These methods allow us to get content inside an existing element.

	  		This method does not accept any arguments.

	  		This method is not available on XML documents.

	  		In an HTML document, .html() can be used to get the contents 
	  		of any element. If the selector expression matches more than 
	  		one element, only the first match will have its HTML content 
	  		returned. Consider this code:		

	  		> $( "div.demo-container" ).html();

	  		In order for the following <div>'s content to be retrieved, 
	  		it would have to be the first one with class="demo-container" 
	  		in the document:

	  		<div class="demo-container">
			  <div class="demo-box">Demonstration Box</div>
			</div>

			The result would look like this:

			<div class="demo-box">Demonstration Box</div>

			This method uses the browser's innerHTML property. Some browsers 
			may not return HTML that exactly replicates the HTML source in 
			an original document. For example, Internet Explorer sometimes 
			leaves off the quotes around attribute values if they contain 
			only alphanumeric characters.

			By design, any jQuery constructor or method that accepts an 
			HTML string — jQuery(), .append(), .after(), etc. — can 
			potentially execute code. This can occur by injection of 
			script tags or use of HTML attributes that execute code 
			(for example, <img onload="">). Do not use these methods 
			to insert strings obtained from untrusted sources such as 
			URL query parameters, cookies, or form inputs. Doing so 
			can introduce cross-site-scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. 
			Remove or escape any user input before adding content to 
			the document.
