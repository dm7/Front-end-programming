				Choosing good selectors is one way to improve JavaScript's 
				performance. A little specificity – for example, including 
				an element type when selecting elements by class name – can 
				go a long way. On the other hand, too much specificity can
				be a bad thing. A selector such as #myTable thead tr th.special 
				is overkill if a selector such as #myTable th.special will get 
				the job done.

				jQuery offers many attribute-based selectors, allowing selections 
				based on the content of arbitrary attributes using simplified 
				regular expressions.

				// Find all <a> elements whose rel attribute ends with "thinger".
				$( "a[rel$='thinger']" );

				While these can be useful in a pinch, they can also be extremely 
				slow in older browsers. Wherever possible, make selections using 
				IDs, class names, and tag names.

				Does My Selection Contain Any Elements?
				======================================
				Once you've made a selection, you'll often want to know whether 
				you have anything to work with. A common mistake is to use:

				// Doesn't work!
				if ( $( "div.foo" ) ) {
				    ...
				}

				This won't work. When a selection is made using $(), an object 
				is always returned, and objects always evaluate to true. Even 
				if the selection doesn't contain any elements, the code inside 
				the if statement will still run.

				The best way to determine if there are any elements is to test 
				the selection's .length property, which tells you how many 
				elements were selected. If the answer is 0, the .length property 
				will evaluate to false when used as a boolean value:

				// Testing whether a selection contains elements.
				if ( $( "div.foo" ).length ) {
				    ...
				}

			/*
				Saving Selections
				=================
				jQuery doesn't cache elements for you. If you've made a selection 
				that you might need to make again, you should save the selection 
				in a variable rather than making the selection repeatedly.

				var divs = $( "div" );

				Once the selection is stored in a variable, you can call jQuery 
				methods on the variable just like you would have called them on 
				the original selection.

				A selection only fetches the elements that are on the page at the 
				time the selection is made. If elements are added to the page later, 
				you'll have to repeat the selection or otherwise add them to the 
				selection stored in the variable. Stored selections don't magically 
				update when the DOM changes.
