				1) Selecting Elements by ID
					$( "#myId" ); // Note IDs must be unique per page.
				
				2) Selecting Elements by Class Name
					$( ".myClass" );

				3) Selecting Elements by Attribute
					$( "input[name='first_name']" ); // Beware, this can be very slow in older browsers

				4) Selecting Elements by Compound CSS Selector
					$( "#contents ul.people li" );

				5) Pseudo-Selectors
					$( "a.external:first" );
					$( "tr:odd" );
					 
					// Select all input-like elements in a form (more on this below).
					$( "#myForm :input" );
					$( "div:visible" );
					 
					// All except the first three divs.
					$( "div:gt(2)" );
					 
					// All currently animated divs.
					$( "div:animated" );

				Note: When using the :visible and :hidden pseudo-selectors, 
				jQuery tests the actual visibility of the element, not its 
				CSS visibility or display properties. jQuery looks to see if 
				the element's physical height and width on the page are both 
				greater than zero.

				However, this test doesn't work with <tr> elements. In the 
				case of <tr> jQuery does check the CSS display property, 
				and considers an element hidden if its display property is 
				set to none.
