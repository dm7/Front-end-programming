				Selecting form elements:
				=======================

				jQuery offers several pseudo-selectors that help find elements 
				in forms. These are especially helpful because it can be difficult 
				to distinguish between form elements based on their state or type 
				using standard CSS selectors.

				1) :checked
					Not to be confused with :checkbox, :checked targets checked checkboxes, 
					but keep in mind that this selector works also for checked radio buttons, 
					and <select> elements (for <select> elements only, use the :selected selector):
				
					$( "form :checked" );
					The :checked pseudo-selector works when used with checkboxes, radio buttons and selects.

				2) :disabled
					Using the :disabled pseudo-selector targets any <input> elements with the disabled attribute:
				
					$( "form :disabled" );
					In order to get the best performance using :disabled, first select 
					elements with a standard jQuery selector, then use .filter( ":disabled" ), 
					or precede the pseudo-selector with a tag name or some other selector.
				
				3) :enabled
					Basically the inverse of the :disabled pseudo-selector, the :enabled 
					pseudo-selector targets any elements that do not have a disabled attribute:
					
					$( "form :enabled" );
					In order to get the best performance using :enabled, first select elements 
					with a standard jQuery selector, then use .filter( ":enabled" ), or precede 
					the pseudo-selector with a tag name or some other selector.
				
				4) :input
					Using the :input selector selects all <input>, <textarea>, <select>, and <button> elements:
					
					$( "form :input" );

				5) :selected
					Using the :selected pseudo-selector targets any selected items in <option> elements:

					$( "form :selected" );
					In order to get the best performance using :selected, first select 
					elements with a standard jQuery selector, then use .filter( ":selected" ), 
					or precede the pseudo-selector with a tag name or some other selector.
