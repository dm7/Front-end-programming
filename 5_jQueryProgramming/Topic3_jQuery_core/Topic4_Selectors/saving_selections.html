				Saving Selections
				=================
				jQuery doesn't cache elements for you. If you've made a selection 
				that you might need to make again, you should save the selection 
				in a variable rather than making the selection repeatedly.

				var divs = $( "div" );

				Once the selection is stored in a variable, you can call jQuery 
				methods on the variable just like you would have called them on 
				the original selection.

				A selection only fetches the elements that are on the page at the 
				time the selection is made. If elements are added to the page later, 
				you'll have to repeat the selection or otherwise add them to the 
				selection stored in the variable. Stored selections don't magically 
				update when the DOM changes.
