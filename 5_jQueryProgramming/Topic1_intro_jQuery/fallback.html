			network tab of your browser inspector.

			if you're running pages from the disk directly, you must specify the protocol.

			Because, if you run a file locally, without a webserver, you 
			cannot use protocol relative paths to load jQuery. That's because 
			it is trying to find a local reference: file://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.2/jquery.min.js

			So yes, if you're running pages from the disk directly,

					This approach does not "defer" execution of other script 
					loading (such as jQuery plugins) or script-execution 
					(such as inline JavaScript) in below page, until after jQuery has 
					fully loaded. Because the fallbacks rely on appending 
					script tags, further script tags after it in the markup 
					would load/execute immediately and not wait for the local 
					jQuery to load, which could cause dependency errors.
					
					So, dynamically created scripts are async so it 
					doesn't block the execution but you can set the async 
					to false explicitly. 

					Another solution for that is to use document.write() and 
					by doing so you will block other JavaScript included lower 
					in the page from loading and executing.

     							document.write('<script type="text/javascript" src="/local/jquery-2.0.min.js"><\/script>');  
					<\/script>  
					So, document.write will add the <script> tag immediately, 
					and then the very next thing the browser does will be to 
					load that script (jQuery, from your server) and evaluate it. 
					Then browser will move on to the next tag.
