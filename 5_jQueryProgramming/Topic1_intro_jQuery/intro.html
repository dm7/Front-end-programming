				jQuery is a lightweight javascript library that simplifies 
				programming with JavaScript.
			
				It makes things like DOM traversal and manipulation, event handling,
				animation and Ajax much simplerthat works across browsers.
			
				If you want to support IE6/7/8, then use jQuery 1.x where as if you
				don't have the need to support IE6/7/8 then use jQuery 2.x
				jQuery2.x is smaller in size than jQuery 1.x

				Q) What does jquery(selector) actually return?
				A) The jQuery Object: The Wrapped Set: Selectors return a 
				jQuery object known as the "wrapped set," which is an 
				array-like structure that contains all the selected 
				DOM elements. You can iterate over the wrapped set like 
				an array or access individual elements via the 
				indexer ($(sel)[0] for example). More importantly, 
				you can also apply jQuery functions against all the 
				selected elements.

				> var obj = jQuery('#button1');
					undefined
				
				> Object.prototype.toString.call(obj);
					"[object Object]"
				
				> Object.prototype.toString.call(obj[0]);
					"[object HTMLInputElement]"

			/*
				All these below three syntaxes are equivalent:
				1) jQuery(document).ready(handler);
				2) $().ready(handler);  Not a recommended usage
				3) $(handler);
				
				The ready event occurs after the HTML document has been loaded, 
				while the window.onload event occurs later, when all content (e.g. images, css) 
				also has been loaded.

				The onload event is a standard event in the DOM, while the ready 
				event is specific to jQuery. The purpose of the ready event is 
				that it should occur as early as possible after the document has 
				loaded, so that code that adds functionality to the elements in 
				the page doesn't have to wait for all content to load.

			jQuery(window).load(function(){
				alert('load window event triggered');
				jQuery('#div1').html("Height= " + jQuery('#img1').height() + "<br>" + "width= " + jQuery('#img1').width());
			});
			
			/*
				For click and most other events, you can prevent the default behavior 
				by calling event.preventDefault() in the event handler:
			*/

			jQuery( document ).ready(function() {
 				jQuery( "a" ).click(function( event ) {
 				alert( "As you can see, the link no longer took you to jquery.com" );
 				event.preventDefault(); // This line avoids the default behavior of navigation
 			});
