/*
	Note:  Some browsers do not support counters.

	You can use counters to number any elements, not only 
	list items. For example, in some documents you might 
	want to number headings or paragraphs.	
	
	To specify numbering, you need a counter with a name that you specify.

	In some element before the counting is to start, reset the counter 
	with the property counter-reset and the name of your counter. The 
	parent of the elements you are counting is a good place to do this, 
	but you can use any element that comes before the list items.
	
	In each element where the counter increments, use the property 
	counter-increment and the name of your counter.

	To display your counter, add ::before or ::after to the selector 
	and use the content property 

	In the value of the content property, specify counter() with the 
	name of your counter. Optionally specify a type. The types are 
	the same as in the Ordered lists section above.

	Normally the element that displays the counter also increments it.
*/

/*
	Example
	This rule initializes a counter for every <h3> element with the class initiate-counter:
*/
h3.initiate-counter {counter-reset: mynum;}

/*
	This rule displays and increments the counter for every <p> element with the class numbered:
*/
body {
   counter-reset: mynum;
}
p.numbered:before {
  content: counter(mynum) ": ";
  counter-increment: mynum;
  font-weight: bold;
}

/*
	If you are able to use counters, they have the advantage 
	that you can style the counters separately from the list 
	items. In the example above, the counters are bold but 
	the list items are not.

	You can also use counters in more complex waysâ€”for example, 
	to number sections, headings, subheadings and paragraphs in 
	formal documents.
