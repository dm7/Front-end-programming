/*
	Summary:
		Attribute selectors select an element using the presence of a given attribute or attribute value.

		[attr]
			Represents an element with an attribute name of attr.
		[attr=value]
			Represents an element with an attribute name of attr and whose value is exactly "value".
		[attr~=value]
			Represents an element with an attribute name of attr whose value is a whitespace-separated 
			list of words, one of which is exactly "value".
		[attr|=value]
			Represents an element with an attribute name of attr. Its value can be exactly “value” 
			or can begin with “value” immediately followed by “-” (U+002D). It can be used for language subcode matches.
		[attr^=value]
			Represents an element with an attribute name of attr and whose value is prefixed by "value".
		[attr$=value]
			Represents an element with an attribute name of attr and whose value is suffixed by "value".
		[attr*=value]
			Represents an element with an attribute name of attr and whose value contains at least 
			one occurrence of string "value" as substring.
		[attr operator value i]
			Adding an i before the closing bracket causes the value to be compared case-insensitively 
			(for characters within the ASCII range).
