	Summary
		The ::first-letter CSS pseudo-element selects the first letter of the 
		first line of a block, if it is not preceded by any other content 
		(such as images or inline tables) on its line.

		The first letter of an element is not necessarily trivial to identify:
		- Punctuation, that is any characters defined in Unicode in the open (Ps), close (Pe),
			 initial quote (Pi), final quote (Pf) and other punctuation (Po) classes, preceding 
			 or immediately following the first letter is also matched by this pseudo-element.
		- Similarly some languages have digraphs that are always capitalized together, like the
			 IJ in Dutch. In these rare cases, both letters of the digraph should be matched by 
			 the ::first-letter pseudo-element. (This is poorly supported by browsers, check 
			 the browser compatibility table).
		- Finally, a combination of the ::before pseudo-element and the content property may 
			 inject some text at the beginning of the element. In that case, ::first-letter 
			 will match the first letter of this generated content.
		

		A first line has meaning only in a block-container box, therefore the ::first-letter
		pseudo-element has an effect only on elements with a display value of block, 
		inline-block, table-cell, list-item or table-caption. In all other cases,
		::first-letter has no effect.

		Only a small subset of all CSS properties can be used inside a declaration block
		of a CSS ruleset containing a selector using the ::first-letter pseudo-element:

		- All font properties : font, font-style, font-feature-settings, font-kerning, 
			font-language-override, font-stretch, font-synthesis, font-variant, 
			font-variant-alternates, font-variant-caps, font-variant-east-asian, 
			font-variant-ligatures, font-variant-numeric, font-variant-position, 
			font-weight, font-size, font-size-adjust, line-height and font-family.
		- All background properties : background-color, background-image, background-clip, 
			background-origin, background-position, background-repeat, background-size, 
			background-attachment, and background-blend-mode.
		- All margin properties: margin, margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, margin-left.
		- All padding properties: padding, padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, padding-left.
		- All border properties: the shorthands border, border-style, border-color, 
			border-width, border-radius, border-image, and the longhands properties.
		- The color property.
		- The text-decoration, text-shadow, text-transform, letter-spacing, word-spacing 
			(when appropriate), line-height, text-decoration-color, text-decoration-line,
			text-decoration-style, box-shadow, float, vertical-align (only if float is none) CSS properties.
