	Some people like the compact layout that we have been using, only splitting a line when it becomes very long:
*/
.carrot {color: orange; text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;}

/*
	Some people prefer one property-value per line:
*/
.carrot
{
color: orange;
text-decoration: underline;
font-style: italic;
}

/*
	Some people use indentionâ€”two spaces, four spaces, or a tab are common:
*/
.carrot {
  color: orange;
  text-decoration: underline;
  font-style: italic;
}

/*
	Some people like everything to line up vertically (but a layout like this is difficult to maintain):
*/

    text-decoration : underline;
