	When a browser displays a document, it must combine the document's content 
	with its style information. It processes the document in two stages:
		
		1) The browser converts the markup language and the CSS into the DOM 
		(Document Object Model). The DOM represents the document in the 
		computer's memory. It combines the document's content with its style.
		2) The browser displays the contents of the DOM. 

	A markup language uses elements to define the document's structure. You
	mark an element using tags, which are strings beginning with '<' and 
	ending with '>'. Most elements have paired tags, a start tag and an end
	tag. For the start tag, place the element name between '<' and '>'. For 
	the end tag, place a '/' after the '<' and before the element name.

	Depending on the markup language, some elements have only a start tag,
	or a single tag where the '/' comes after the element name. An element
	can also be a container and include other elements between its start tag
	and end tag. Just remember to always close the tags inside the container.

	A DOM has a tree-like structure. Each element, attribute and run of text 
	in the markup language becomes a node in the tree structure. The nodes 
	are defined by their relationship to other DOM nodes. Some elements are
	parents of child nodes, and child nodes have siblings.

	Understanding the DOM helps you design, debug and maintain your CSS, 
	because the DOM is where your CSS and the document's content meet up.

	Example
 
	In below sample document, the <p> tag and its end tag </p> create a container:

-->

<p>
  <strong>C</strong>ascading
  <strong>S</strong>tyle
  <strong>S</strong>heets
</p>

<!--
 	In the DOM, the corresponding P node is a parent. Its children are the 
 	STRONG nodes and the text nodes. The STRONG nodes are themselves parents, 
 	with text nodes "C" as their children: 

 	P
	├─STRONG
	│ └─"C"
	├─"ascading"
	├─STRONG
	│ └─"S"
	├─"tyle"
	├─STRONG
	│ └─"S"
	└─"heets"

<!-- 
	Analyzing a DOM: Using DOM Inspector
	
	To analyze a DOM, you need special software. You can use Mozilla's DOM 
	Inspector (DOMi) add-on to analyze a DOM. You simply need to install the add-on
	
	1. Use your Mozilla browser to open your sample HTML document.
	
	2. From your browser's menu bar, choose Tools > DOM Inspector, or Tools > Web Development > DOM Inspector.
	
	3. In DOMi, expand your document's nodes by clicking on their arrows.
	Note:  Spacing in your HTML file may cause DOMi to show some empty text nodes, which you can ignore.	

	When you select any node, you can use DOMi's right-hand pane to find out more about it.
	For example, when you select a text node, DOMi shows you the text in the right-hand pane.

	When you select an element node, DOMi analyzes it and provides a huge amount of information 
	in its right-hand pane. Style information is just part of the information it provides.
