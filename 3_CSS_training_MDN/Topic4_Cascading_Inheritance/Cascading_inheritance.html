<!--
	The final style for an element can be specified in many different places,
	which can interact in a complex way. This complex interaction makes CSS 
	powerful, but it can also make it confusing and difficult to debug.

	Three main sources of style information form a cascade. They are:

		1) The browser's default styles for the markup language.
		2) Styles specified by a user who is reading the document.
		3) The styles linked to the document by its author. These can be specified in three places:
			In an external file: this tutorial primarily discusses this method of defining styles.
			In a definition at the beginning of the document: use this method only for styles that are used only on that page.
			On a specific element in the body of the document: this is the least maintainable method, but can be used for testing.

	The user's style modifies the browser's default style. The document 
	author's style then modifies the style some more. In this tutorial, 
	you are the author of your sample document, and you only work with 
	author stylesheets.
	
	
	As mentioned in first point above,
	a) browser's default style sheet for webkit - http://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/Source/WebCore/css/html.css
	b) browser's default style sheet for firefox - http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/layout/style/html.css
	Example: When you open your sample document in your browser, the <strong> elements are bolder
	than the rest of the text. This comes from the browser's default style for HTML.

	As mentioned in second point above, procedure is given here:
	a) In firefox - https://ffeathers.wordpress.com/2013/03/10/how-to-override-css-stylesheets-in-firefox/
	b) In chrome(not possible) - https://codereview.chromium.org/66383005/
	c) In IE - http://webdesign.about.com/od/css/ht/htcssuseriewin.htm


	The <strong> elements also inherit much of the <p> element's style, because they
	are its children. In the same way, the <p> element inherits much of the <body> 
	element's style.

	For styles in the cascade, author stylesheets have priority, then reader stylesheets, 
	then the browser's defaults. For inherited styles, a child node's own style has priority 
	over style inherited from its parent.

<!-- 
	The underlining affects all the text in the paragraph, including the initial 
	letters. The <strong> elements have inherited the underlined style from their
	parent <p> element.
 
	But the <strong> elements are still red. The red color is their own style, 
	so it has priority over the blue color of their parent <p> element.
