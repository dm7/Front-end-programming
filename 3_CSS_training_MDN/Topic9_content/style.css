/*
	Content:
	One of the important advantages of CSS is that it helps 
	you to separate a document's style from its content. Yet 
	there are situations where it makes sense to specify certain 
	content as part of the stylesheet, not as part of the document.
	
	Content specified in a stylesheet can consist of text or images. 
	You specify content in your stylesheet when the content is 
	closely linked to the document's structure.
	
	-------------------------------------------------------------
	How to reference a theme image in a stylesheet?

	.theme-image {
 		 background-image: url('../images/header-img.jpg');
	}

	The above code is for the structure

		wp-content
		 - themes
		  - your-theme 
		    - images
		     - header-img.jpg
		    - css
		     - style.css
	You are making the browser come one directory before and search for images directory.

	--------------------------------------------------------------

	Text content

	CSS can insert text content before or after an element. To specify 
	this, make a rule and add ::before or ::after to the selector. In 
	the declaration, specify the content property with the text content
	as its value.

	Example
	HTML

		A text where I need to <span class="ref">something</span>
*/

.ref::before {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: navy;
  content: "Reference: ";
}

/*
	The character set of a stylesheet is UTF-8 by default, but it can be 
	specified in the link, or in the stylesheet itself, or in other ways. 
	For details, see 4.4 CSS style sheet representation in the CSS Specification.

	Individual characters can also be specified by an escape mechanism that 
	uses backslash as the escape character. For example, \265B is the chess
	symbol for a black queen â™›. For details, see Referring to characters 
	not represented in a character encoding and also Characters and case 
	in the CSS Specification.

*/

/*
	Image content

	To add an image before or after an element, you can specify the URL 
	of an image file in the value of the content property.

	Example
	This rule adds a space and an icon after every link that has the class glossary:
*/
a.glossary:after {content: " " url("../images/glossary-icon.gif");}

/*
	To add an image as an element's background, specify the URL of an 
	image file in the value of the background property. This is a 
	shorthand property that specifies the background color, the image,
	how the image repeats, and some other details.

	Example
	This rule sets the background of a specific element, using a URL to 
	specify an image file.

	The selector specifies the element's id. The value no-repeat makes 
	the image appear only once:
*/
#sidebar-box {background: url("../images/sidebar-ground.png") no-repeat;}
