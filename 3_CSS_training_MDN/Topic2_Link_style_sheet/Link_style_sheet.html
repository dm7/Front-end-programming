	Styling can be added to HTML elements in 3 ways:
	•	Inline - using a style attribute in HTML elements
	•	Internal - using a <style> element in the HTML <head> section
	•	External - using one or more external CSS files

	The most frequent to add styling, is to keep the styles in separate CSS files.
	
	Use CSS to define styles for your documents, including the design, layout 
	and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes. You can 
	place your CSS in the <head> of a document with an embedded style sheet, 
	or attach a separate file that defines your styles with an external style 
	sheet. To link an external style sheet to your document, you'll simply 
	add a link to the style sheet in the <head> of the document.

	An external style sheet has many advantages. Keeping the styles separate 
	from your HTML content:
		Helps avoid duplication
		Makes maintenance easier
		Allows you to make a site-wide change in one place

	Example
	[Using CSS, you store the style information in common files that all the 
	pages share. For example, when the documents link to the same style sheet
	that defines the color of h2 headers, you can apply the style for h2 header
	tags globally by changing one css attribute.]
	
	When a user displays a web page, the user's browser loads the style
	information along with the content of the page.

	When a user prints a web page, you can provide different style information
	that makes the printed page easy to read.

	How do HTML and CSS work together? 
	In general, you use HTML to describe the content of the document, not its 
	style. You use CSS to specify the document's style, not its content. Later
	in this tutorial, you will see some exceptions to this arrangement.

	Example:
	[A markup language like HTML also provides some ways to specify style.
	
	For example, in HTML you can use a <b> tag to make text bold, and you 
	can specify the background color of a page in its <body> tag.

	When you use CSS, you normally avoid using these features of the markup
	language so that all your document's style information is in one place.]
