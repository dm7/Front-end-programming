/*
	Lists:
		CSS provides special properties that are designed for lists. It 
		is usually more convenient to use these properties whenever you can.

		To specify the style for a list, use the list-style property to 
		specify the type of marker.

		The selector in your CSS rule can either select the list item 
		elements (for example, <li>), or it can select the parent list 
		element (for example, <ul>) so that the list elements inherit the style.
*/

/*
	If you are using a markup language like HTML that provides conventional 
	tags for unordered (<ul>) and ordered (<ol>) lists, then it is good 
	practice to use the tags in the way they were intended. However, you 
	can use CSS to make <ul> display ordered and <ol> display unordered 
	if you wish.

	Browsers differ in the way they implement the styles for lists. Do 
	not expect your stylesheet to give identical results in all browsers.
