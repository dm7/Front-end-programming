/*
	Unordered lists
	
	In an unordered list, each list item is marked in the same way.
	
	CSS has three types of markers, and here is how your browser displays them:

		disc
		circle
		square
	
	Alternatively, you can specify the URL of an image.

li.open {list-style: circle;}
li.closed {list-style: disc;}
