Overlapping style of media queries:
	Order of media queries matter.
	There is overriding issue.
	No need to repeat styles.
	

Individual/back-to-back style of media queries:
	Order of media queries does not matter.
	There is no overriding issue.
	Repeating styles a few times.
	Avoids unnecessary download of images with high bandwidth usage.


There is no reason one style is preferred over other.If the elements require similar styles, one can use overlapping approach.

There should be minimal code outside media query.

Mobile style is lighter than desktop style in terms of elements and images downloaded on http request. 

On using overlap  approach, if desktop style media query is written before mobile style media query, then all the resources related to desktop style will be loaded on mobile.
