				<h3>Blog Post One</h3>

				<p>
					Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the
					printing and <strong>typesetting industry.</strong>
					Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard 
					dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
					printer took a galley of type and scrambled it
					to make a type specimen book. It has survived
					not only five centuries, but also the leap into
					electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
					unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
					with the release of Letraset sheets containing
					Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with
					desktop publishings
